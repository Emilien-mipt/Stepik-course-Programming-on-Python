      "Whistling, he let the escalator waft him into the still night air. He walked toward the corner, thinking little at all about nothing in particular. Before he reached the corner, however, he slowed as if a wind had sprung up from nowhere, as if someone had called his name.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last few nights he had had the most uncertain feelings about the sidewalk just around the corner here, moving in the starlight toward his house. He had felt that a moment prior to his making the turn, someone had been there. The air seemed charged with a special calm as if someone had waited there, quietly, and only a moment before he came, simply turned to a shadow and let him through. Perhaps his nose detected a faint perfume, perhaps the skin on the backs of his hands, on his face, felt the temperature rise at this one spot where a person's standing might raise the immediate atmosphere ten degrees for an instant. There was no understanding it. Each time he made the turn, he saw only the white, unused, buckling sidewalk, with perhaps, on one night, something vanishing swiftly across a lawn before he could focus his eyes or speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now tonight, he slowed almost to a stop. His inner mind, reaching out to turn the corner for him, had heard the faintest whisper. Breathing? Or was the atmosphere compressed merely by someone standing very quietly there, waiting?\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned the corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The autumn leaves blew over the moonlit pavement in such a way as to make the girl who was moving there seem fixed to a sliding walk, letting the motion of the wind and the leaves carry her forward.  Her head was half bent to watch her shoes stir the circling leaves. Her face was slender and milk-white, and in it was a kind of gentle hunger that touched over everything with tireless curiosity. It was a look, almost, of pale surprise; the dark eyes were so fixed to the world that no move escaped them. Her dress was white and it whispered. He almost thought he heard  the motion of her hands as she walked, and the infinitely small sound now, the white stir of her face turning when she discovered she was a moment away from a man who stood in the middle of the pavement waiting. \n",
      "\n",
      "The trees overhead made a great sound of letting down their dry rain. The girl stopped and looked as if she might pull back in surprise, but instead stood regarding Montag with eyes so dark and shining and alive that he felt he had said something quite wonderful. But he knew his mouth had only moved to say hello, and then when she seemed hypnotized by the salamander on his arm and the phoenix disc on his chest, he spoke again. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course,\" he said, \"you're our new neighbor, aren't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you must be\" -- she raised her eyes from his professional symbols \"-- the fireman.\" Her voice trailed off. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"How oddly you say that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'd -- I'd have known it with my eyes shut,\" she said, slowly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What -- the smell of kerosene? My wife always complains,\" he laughed. \"You never wash it off completely.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, you don't,\" she said, in awe.\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt she was walking in a circle about him, turning him end for end, shaking him quietly, andemptying his pockets, without once moving herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Kerosene,\" he said, because the silence had lengthened, \"is nothing but perfume to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Does it seem like that, really?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course. Why not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She gave herself time to think of it. \"I don't know.\" She turned to face the sidewalk going toward their homes. \"Do you mind if I walk back with you? I'm Clarisse McClellan.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Clarisse. Guy Montag. Come along. What are you doing out so late wandering around? How old are you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They walked in the warm-cool blowing night on the silvered pavement and there was the faintest breath of fresh apricots and strawberries in the air, and he looked around and realized this was quite impossible, so late in the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was only the girl walking with him now, her face bright as snow in the moonlight, and he knew she was working his questions around, seeking the best answers she could possibly give.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" she said, \"I'm seventeen and I'm crazy; My uncle says the two always go together. When people ask your age, he said, always say seventeen and insane. Isn't this a nice time of night to walk? I like to smell things and look at things, and sometimes stay up all night, walking, and watch the sun rise.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They walked on again in silence and finally she said, thoughtfully, \"You know, I'm not afraid of you at all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was surprised. \"Why should you be?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So many people are. Afraid of firemen, I mean. But you're just a man, after all ...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He saw himself in her eyes, suspended in two shining drops of bright water, himself dark and tiny, in fine detail, the lines about his mouth, everything there, as if her eyes were two miraculous bits of violet amber that might capture and hold him intact. Her face, turned to him now, was fragile milk crystal with a soft and constant light in it. It was not the hysterical light of electricity but -- what? But the strangely comfortable and rare and gently flattering light of the candle. One time, as a child, in a power failure, his mother had found and lit a last candle and there had been a brief hour of rediscovery, of such illumination that space lost its vast dimensions and drew comfortably around them, and they, mother and son, alone, transformed, hoping that the power might not come on again too soon ...\n",
      "\n",
      "And then Clarisse McClellan said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you mind if I ask? How long've you worked at being a fireman?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Since I was twenty, ten years ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you ever read any of the books you burn?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He laughed. \"That's against the law!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh. Of course.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's fine work. Monday burn Millay, Wednesday Whitman, Friday Faulkner, burn 'em to ashes, then burn the ashes. That's our official slogan.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They walked still farther and the girl said, \"Is it true that long ago firemen put fires out instead of going to start them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No. Houses have always been fireproof, take my word for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Strange. I heard once that a long time ago houses used to burn by accident and they needed firemen to stop the flames.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "She glanced quickly over. \"Why are you laughing?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know.\" He started to laugh again and stopped. \"Why?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You laugh when I haven't been funny and you answer right off. You never stop to think what I've asked you.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped walking. \"You are an odd one,\" he said, looking at her. \"Haven't you any respect?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't mean to be insulting. It's just I love to watch people too much, I guess.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, doesn't this mean anything to you?\" He tapped the numerals 451 stitched on his char-colored sleeve.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" she whispered. She increased her pace. \"Have you ever watched the jet cars racing on the boulevards down that way?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're changing the subject!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I sometimes think drivers don't know what grass is, or flowers, because they never see them slowly,\" she said. \"If you showed a driver a green blur, Oh yes! he'd say, that's grass! A pink blur! That's a rose garden! White blurs are houses. Brown blurs are cows.  My uncle drove slowly on a highway once. He drove forty miles an hour and they jailed him for two days.  Isn't that funny, and sad, too?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You think too many things,\" said Montag, uneasily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I rarely watch the 'parlor walls' or go to races or Fun Parks. So I've lots of time for crazy thoughts, I guess. Have you seen the two hundred-foot-long billboards in the country beyond town ? Did you know that once billboards were only twenty feet long? But cars started rushing by so quickly they had to stretch the advertising out so it would last.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't know that!\" Montag laughed abruptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bet I know something else you don't. There's dew on the grass in the morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He suddenly couldn't remember if he had known this or not, and it made him quite irritable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And if you look\" -- she nodded at the sky -- \"there's a man in the moon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He hadn't looked for a long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "They walked the rest of the way in silence, hers thoughtful, his a kind of clenching and uncomfortable silence in which he shot her accusing glances.  When they reached her house all its lights were blazing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's going on?\" Montag had rarely seen that many house lights.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, just my mother and father and uncle sitting around, talking. It's like being a pedestrian, only rarer. My uncle was arrested another time -- did I tell  you? -- for being a pedestrian. Oh, we're most peculiar.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what do you talk about?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She laughed at this. \"Good night!\" She started up her walk. Then she seemed to remember something and came back to look at him with wonder and curiosity. \"Are you happy?\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Am I what?\" he cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she was gone -- running in the moonlight. Her front door shut gently.\n",
      "\n",
      "***\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Happy! Of all the nonsense.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "He put his hand into the glove hole of his front door and let it know his touch. The front door slid open.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course I'm happy. What does she think? I'm not? he asked the quiet rooms. He stood looking up at the ventilator grille in the hall and suddenly remembered that something lay hidden behind the grille, something that seemed to peer down at him now. He moved his eyes quickly away.\n",
      "\n",
      "What a strange meeting on a strange night. He  remembered nothing like it save one afternoon a year ago when he had met an old man in the park and they had talked ...\n",
      "\n",
      "Montag shook his head. He looked at a blank wall. The girl's face was there, really quite beautiful in memory: astonishing, in fact. She had a very thin face like the dial of a small clock seen faintly in a dark room in the middle of a night when you waken to see the time and see the clock telling you the hour and the minute and the second, with a white silence and a glowing, all certainty and knowing what it had to tell of the night passing swiftly on toward further darknesses, but moving also toward a new sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What?\" asked Montag of that other self, the subconscious idiot that ran babbling at times, quite independent of will, habit, and conscience.\n",
      "\n",
      "He glanced back at the wall. How like a mirror, too, her face. Impossible; for how many people did you know who refracted your own light to you? People were more often -- he searched for a simile, found one in his work -- torches, blazing away until they whiffed out. How rarely did other people's faces take of you and throw back to you your own expression, your own innermost trembling thought?\n",
      "\n",
      "What incredible power of identification the girl had; she was like the eager watcher of a marionette show, anticipating each flicker of an eyelid, each gesture of his hand, each flick of a finger, the moment before it began. How long had they walked together?  Three minutes? Five? Yet how large that time seemed now. How immense a figure she was on the stage before him; what a shadow she threw on the wall with her slender body! He felt that if his eye itched, she might blink. And if the muscles of his jaws stretched imperceptibly, she would yawn long before he would.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, he thought, now that I think of it, she almost seemed to be waiting for me there, in the street, so damned late at night ...\n",
      "\n",
      "***\n",
      "\n",
      "He opened the bedroom door.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was like coming into the cold marbled room of a mausoleum after the moon has set. Complete darkness, not a hint of the silver world outside, the windows tightly shut, the chamber a tomb world where no sound from the great city could penetrate. The room was not empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "He listened.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little mosquito-delicate dancing hum in the air, the electrical murmur of a hidden wasp snug in its special pink warm nest. The music was almost loud enough so he could follow the tune.\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt his smile slide away, melt, fold over and down on itself like a tallow skin, like the stuff of a fantastic candle burning too long and now collapsing and now blown out. Darkness. He was not happy. He was not happy. He said the words to himself. He recognized this as the true state of affairs. He wore his happiness like a mask and the girl had run off across the lawn with the mask and there was no way of going to knock on her door and ask for it back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without turning on the light he imagined how this room would look. His wife stretched on the bed, uncovered and cold, like a body displayed on the lid of a tomb, her eyes fixed to the ceiling by invisible threads of steel, immovable. And in her ears the little Seashells, the thimble radios tamped tight, and an electronic ocean of sound, of music and talk and music and talk coming in, coming in on the shore of her unsleeping mind. The room was indeed empty. Every night the waves came in and bore her off on their great tides of sound, floating her, wide-eyed, toward  morning. There had been no night in the last two years that Mildred had not swum that sea, had not gladly gone down in it for the third time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The room was cold but nonetheless he felt he could not breathe. He did not wish to open the drapes and open the French windows, for he did not want the moon to come into the room. So, with the feeling  of a man who will die in the next hour for lack of air, he felt his way toward his open, separate, and therefore cold bed. \n",
      "\n",
      "An instant before his foot hit the object on the floor he knew he would hit such an object. It was not unlike the feeling he had experienced before turning the corner and almost knocking the girl down. His foot, sending vibrations ahead, received back echoes of the small barrier across its path even as the foot swung. His foot kicked. The object gave a dull clink and slid off in darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stood very straight and listened to the person on the dark bed in the completely featureless night.  The breath coming out the nostrils was so faint it stirred only the farthest fringes of life, a small leaf, a black feather, a single fibre of hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "He still did not want outside light. He pulled out his igniter, felt the salamander etched on its silver disc, gave it a flick ...\n",
      "\n",
      "Two moonstones looked up at him in the light of his small hand-held fire; two pale moonstones buried in a creek of clear water over which the life of the world ran, not touching them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mildred!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her face was like a snow-covered island upon which rain might fall, but it felt no rain; over which clouds might pass their moving shadows, but she felt no shadow. There was only the singing of the thimble-wasps in her tamped-shut ears, and her eyes all glass, and breath going in and out, softly, faintly, in and out her nostrils, and her not caring whether it came or went, went or came.\n",

Darkness. He was not happy. He was not happy. He said the words to himself. He recognized this as the true state of affairs. He wore his happiness like a mask and the girl had run off across the lawn with the mask and there was no way of going to knock on her door and ask for it back.', '', 'Without turning on the light he imagined how this room would look. His wife stretched on the bed, uncovered and cold, like a body displayed on the lid of a tomb, her eyes fixed to the ceiling by invisible threads of steel, immovable. And in her ears the little Seashells, the thimble radios tamped tight, and an electronic ocean of sound, of music and talk and music and talk coming in, coming in on the shore of her unsleeping mind. The room was indeed empty. Every night the waves came in and bore her off on their great tides of sound, floating her, wide-eyed, toward  morning. There had been no night in the last two years that Mildred had not swum that sea, had not gladly gone down in it for the third time.', '', 'The room was cold but nonetheless he felt he could not breathe. He did not wish to open the drapes and open the French windows, for he did not want the moon to come into the room. So, with the feeling  of a man who will die in the next hour for lack of air, he felt his way toward his open, separate, and therefore cold bed. ', '', 'An instant before his foot hit the object on the floor he knew he would hit such an object. It was not unlike the feeling he had experienced before turning the corner and almost knocking the girl down. His foot, sending vibrations ahead, received back echoes of the small barrier across its path even as the foot swung. His foot kicked. The object gave a dull clink and slid off in darkness.', '', 'He stood very straight and listened to the person on the dark bed in the completely featureless night.  The breath coming out the nostrils was so faint it stirred only the farthest fringes of life, a small leaf, a black feather, a single fibre of hair.', '', 'He still did not want outside light. He pulled out his igniter, felt the salamander etched on its silver disc, gave it a flick ...', '', 'Two moonstones looked up at him in the light of his small hand-held fire; two pale moonstones buried in a creek of clear water over which the life of the world ran, not touching them.', '', '\"Mildred!\"', '', 'Her face was like a snow-covered island upon which rain might fall, but it felt no rain; over which clouds might pass their moving shadows, but she felt no shadow. There was only the singing of the thimble-wasps in her tamped-shut ears, and her eyes all glass, and breath going in and out, softly, faintly, in and out her nostrils, and her not caring whether it came or went, went or came.', '']\n",
